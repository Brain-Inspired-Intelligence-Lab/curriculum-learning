# Curriculum Learning Workshop — ICARC 2026

**International Conference on Advances in Computing (ICARC) 2026**

This repository hosts the website and materials for the **Curriculum Learning: An Efficient Learning Paradigm** tutorial at ICARC 2026.

## Overview

**Curriculum Learning (CL)** is a brain-inspired training paradigm that structures learning from easy to hard examples, similar to how humans and animals acquire complex skills. Since its formalization, CL has been shown to:

- Accelerate convergence and smooth optimization  
- Improve generalization compared to uniform sampling  
- Work across computer vision, NLP, graph neural networks, and multiple learning paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, self-supervised, reinforcement, continual learning)

This **full-day tutorial** combines:

- Conceptual foundations and taxonomy of CL methods  
- Reproductions of classical CL experiments (Baseline vs CL vs Anti-CL)  
- Hands-on sessions with code and reproducible setups  
- Discussion of efficiency (data-, parameter-, and computational efficiency)
